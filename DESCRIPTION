Title: Calculate adjacency vectors using horizon of observation model
Version: 3.4.5
Authors@R: person("Shengyang", "Cao", email = "scaotravis@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: "hoo" generates adjacency vector and ENA accumulated data environment suitable for multimodal analysis under Hutchins' horizon of observation model. This model takes player perspective into consideration: in an interactive environment, players might observe some types of player actions, but not others. This package builds ENA connections in the way that can be observed by each individual user, and generate ENA readable accumulated environment for ENA model analysis (see package "rENA" for more information on how connections are built and interpreted).
